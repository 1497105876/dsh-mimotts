/**
 * Host-side persistence for synthesized speech.
 *
 * Every spoken text becomes one recording node; each synthesis — first pass
 * or a later re-synthesis — appends a version with its own WAV file on disk.
 * A single `index.json` records the tree so the browser can list history
 * without scanning directories. The store lives under `~/.dsh`, outside the
 * plugin and any repository, so no recording leaks into version control.
 *
 * Re-synthesis never overwrites: it adds a new version, leaving earlier
 * takes intact so the user can compare voices side by side.
 * @module dsh-mimotts/recordings
